      <p>
        Heart disease remains the leading cause of death among women.
        Recognizing early signs like fatigue, shortness of breath, or chest
        discomfort is key to early intervention and treatment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Gynecological Health</h2>
      <p>
        This includes menstruation problems, pelvic pain, and fertility issues.
        Regular gynecological exams help detect early signs of infections,
        cysts, or cancer.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</h2>
      <p>
        PCOS affects hormone levels, leading to irregular periods, infertility,
        and weight gain. Early diagnosis and lifestyle changes can improve
        outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Endometriosis</h2>
      <p>
        A painful condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows
        outside the uterus. Treatments range from pain relief to surgical
        options.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Breast Cancer</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/oby3.jpg" alt="Breast Cancer Screening" />
      <p>
        Early detection through mammograms and self-exams can save lives. Know
        the warning signs like lumps, nipple discharge, or changes in breast
        shape.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">When to See an OB-GYN</h2>
      <p>
        It's recommended to have an annual visit to your gynecologist, or more
        frequently if you're experiencing abnormal symptoms like pelvic pain,
        unusual discharge, or missed periods.
