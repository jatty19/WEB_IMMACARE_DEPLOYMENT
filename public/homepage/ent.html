        From age-related hearing loss to sudden vertigo, our ENT team offers advanced diagnostics such as audiometry and vestibular tests, as well as hearing aid fitting and surgical solutions.

      <h2 class="section-title">Voice and Swallowing</h2>
      <p>
        Hoarseness, vocal strain, and difficulty swallowing can be signs of underlying ENT issues. We use video laryngoscopy and other tools to diagnose vocal cord problems and swallowing disorders.

        Consult an ENT if you have persistent sinus problems, hearing loss, frequent throat infections, or difficulty speaking or swallowing. Early treatment prevents complications and improves quality of life.
