      <p>
        Children are susceptible to a wide range of conditions including allergies, asthma, ear infections, and gastrointestinal issues. Pediatricians provide care tailored to a child’s physical and emotional development.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Vaccination & Preventive Care</h2>
      <p>
        Immunizations are crucial to protect children from dangerous diseases such as measles, polio, and influenza. Your pediatrician will help you stay on schedule with routine vaccines.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Nutrition & Lifestyle Guidance</h2>
      <p>
        From infancy through adolescence, proper nutrition is essential. Pediatricians offer advice on breastfeeding, introducing solid foods, managing picky eaters, and addressing childhood obesity.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Behavioral and Mental Health</h2>

      <p>
        Pediatric care also includes support for behavioral issues, anxiety, ADHD, and autism. Early detection and therapy play a critical role in long-term outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">When to Visit a Pediatrician</h2>
      <p>
        Routine check-ups should occur at birth, during key milestones (2, 4, 6, 12 months, etc.), and annually after age 2. Visit your pediatrician for illness, developmental concerns, or behavioral issues.
